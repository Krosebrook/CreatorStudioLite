Overview

SparkLabs is a Bolt.new project that gives creators and teams a single studio to plan, brand, produce, publish, monetise, and measure content. Bolt.new lets you prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack apps in the browser, so SparkLabs ships as a modular workspace with connectors for social/video, design, storage, analytics, ecommerce, email/CRM, community, and AI.

/src/connectors: tiny wrappers with strict env validation (Zod).

/src/workflows: job queue handlers (upload → post → schedule → fetch metrics).

/src/rbac: roles, scopes, policy checks.

/api/ routes: OAuth callbacks + webhook receivers (Stripe, etc.).

/scripts/: health checks and smoke tests for connectors.
